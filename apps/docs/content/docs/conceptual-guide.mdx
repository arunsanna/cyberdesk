Understanding the core concepts of Cyberdesk will help you build more effective applications.

## Architecture Overview

Cyberdesk is built on a microservices architecture that provides scalable, reliable access to virtual desktop environments. The system consists of:

- **API Service**: The backend service accessed via the SDK.
- **Desktop Pool**: Managed virtual desktop instances.
- **Stream Service**: Real-time visual streaming of desktop environments.
- **Database**: Persistent storage for desktop metadata and user information.

## Desktop Instances

A desktop instance is a virtual desktop environment running in the cloud. Each instance:

- Has a unique identifier (UUID format).
- Runs in an isolated environment for security.
- Can be controlled programmatically through the **SDK methods**.
- Provides a `stream_url` (obtained via SDK methods) for visual feedback.
- Persists until explicitly stopped (via `terminateDesktop`) or times out.
- Has configurable resources (CPU, memory, storage) - future feature.

When creating a desktop instance using `launchDesktop`, you can specify a custom timeout in milliseconds using the `body.timeout_ms` parameter. This allows you to control how long the desktop instance will remain active before being automatically terminated. If not specified, a default timeout is applied. Check your plan for maximum allowed timeout values.

## Computer Actions

Cyberdesk supports various computer actions to interact with the desktop via the **`executeComputerAction` SDK method**. Actions are specified using a `body` object containing a `type` field and associated parameters:

### Mouse Actions

- **`type: 'click_mouse'`**: Perform a mouse action (click, press down, or release up).
  - `x`, `y` (optional): Coordinates for the click.
  - `button` (optional): `left`, `right`, or `middle` (defaults to `left`).
  - `num_of_clicks` (optional): Number of clicks (defaults to 1, for `click_type: 'click'`).
  - `click_type` (optional): `click` (down and up), `down` (press), or `up` (release) (defaults to `click`).
- **`type: 'scroll'`**: Scroll the mouse wheel.
  - `direction`: `up`, `down`, `left`, or `right`.
  - `amount`: Amount to scroll in pixels.
- **`type: 'move_mouse'`**: Move the mouse cursor to specific coordinates.
  - `x`, `y`: Target coordinates.
- **`type: 'drag_mouse'`**: Drag the mouse from a start point to an end point.
  - `start`: `{ x, y }` starting coordinates.
  - `end`: `{ x, y }` ending coordinates.

### Keyboard Actions

- **`type: 'type'`**: Type text at the current cursor position.
  - `text`: The string to type.
- **`type: 'press_keys'`**: Press, hold down, or release keyboard keys.
  - `keys`: A single key string (e.g., `'Enter'`) or an array of keys to press simultaneously (e.g., `['Control', 'c']`).
  - `key_action_type` (optional): `press` (down and up), `down` (hold), or `up` (release) (defaults to `press`).

### Other Actions

- **`type: 'wait'`**: Pause execution for a specified duration.
  - `ms`: Time to wait in milliseconds.
- **`type: 'screenshot'`**: Capture the current state of the desktop.
  - Returns a `base64_image` field in the successful response object.
- **`type: 'get_cursor_position'`**: Get the current mouse cursor coordinates.
  - Returns `x`, `y` coordinates in the successful response object.

## Bash Actions

Bash actions allow you to execute shell commands on the desktop instance via the **`executeBashAction` SDK method**. This is useful for:

- Installing software
- Running applications
- Manipulating files
- Executing scripts
- System configuration

The method accepts a `body.command` parameter containing the shell command to execute and returns the command `output` (stdout/stderr) as a string in the successful response object.

## Desktop Streaming

Cyberdesk provides real-time streaming of desktop visuals. The `stream_url` obtained from the `launchDesktop` or `getDesktop` SDK methods can be used for:

1.  **Web-based Viewer**: Opening the URL in a browser.
2.  **VNC Protocol**: Connecting with a VNC client (if the stream URL supports it).
3.  **Embedded Iframe**: Embedding the desktop view directly in your web applications.

The streaming service aims for low-latency transmission suitable for real-time interaction.

## Authentication and Security

Cyberdesk uses API keys for authentication. The **SDK client is initialized with your API key**, which is then automatically included in all requests.

- API keys are associated with a specific user account.
- Rate limits apply to prevent abuse.
- Keys can be revoked or regenerated from your dashboard.
- Keep your API key secure.

Communication with the API is encrypted using TLS/SSL.

## Resource Management

Cyberdesk automatically manages resources:

- Desktop instances are cleaned up when stopped via the **`terminateDesktop` SDK method** or when they reach their timeout.
- Users are responsible for stopping instances when no longer needed to manage costs and resources.
- Resource quotas and limits may apply depending on your subscription plan.

## Error Handling

The Cyberdesk **SDK methods** simplify error handling. Each method returns a promise that resolves to an object. You should check if this object contains an `error` property:

```typescript
const result = await cyberdesk.someMethod(...);

if ('error' in result) {
  // Handle the error
  console.error('Cyberdesk SDK Error:', result.error);
  // The 'error' property contains the descriptive error message from the API
} else {
  // Process the successful result
  console.log('Success:', result);
}
```

Common error scenarios include:
- Invalid parameters in the request body (`body` property of the method call).
- Missing or invalid API key (during client initialization or if the key is revoked).
- Attempting an action not allowed by your plan.
- Referencing a non-existent desktop instance ID (`path.id`).
- Rate limit exceeded.
- Server-side issues on the Cyberdesk platform.

Check the specific error message returned in the `error` property for details.

## Performance Considerations

When building applications with the Cyberdesk SDK, consider:

- **API Call Latency**: Network latency affects the time it takes for SDK methods to complete.
- **Action Duration**: Some actions (like `wait` or long bash commands) naturally take time.
- **Streaming Latency**: There will be some delay in the visual stream.
- **Error Retries**: For transient issues (like network errors or potential server-side hiccups), consider implementing retry logic around your SDK calls, possibly with exponential backoff.

## Billing and Usage

Cyberdesk billing is typically based on factors like:

- **Active Desktop Time**: The duration desktop instances are running (often billed per second or minute).
