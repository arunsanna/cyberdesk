Cyberdesk provides a seamless way to create and interact with virtual desktop environments through a simple API. Whether you're building automation tools, testing applications, creating AI agents that can use computers, or developing remote desktop solutions, Cyberdesk offers a robust platform to handle your virtual desktop needs.

## What is Cyberdesk?

Cyberdesk is a cloud-based service that allows you to:

- Create virtual desktop instances on demand via the SDK
- Control desktop interactions programmatically (mouse movements, clicks, keyboard input) using SDK methods
- Execute bash commands remotely via the SDK
- Manage desktop lifecycle (creation, interaction, termination) through the SDK
- Stream desktop visuals to your applications or AI agents

## Key Features

- **Simple SDK**: An easy-to-use TypeScript SDK for Node.js and browser environments
- **Programmatic Control**: Full control over mouse, keyboard, and system actions via intuitive SDK functions
- **Secure Authentication**: Simple API key configuration within the SDK
- **Streaming Capability**: Stream desktop visuals to your applications with VNC support (SDK helps manage instance details)
- **Resource Management**: Efficient creation and cleanup of desktop instances managed via SDK calls
- **AI Integration**: Easily integrate with AI models like Claude or GPT to create agents that can use computers (see tutorials)
- **Cross-Platform**: Works across different operating systems and environments
- **Low Latency**: Fast response times for real-time interaction

## Use Cases

Cyberdesk is ideal for a variety of applications:

- **AI Agents**: Create AI assistants that can interact with desktop applications
- **Automated Testing**: Test desktop applications with programmatic control
- **Remote Automation**: Control desktop environments from anywhere
- **Demo Environments**: Create disposable demo environments for software showcases
- **Training Data Generation**: Generate training data for computer vision models
- **Virtual Workstations**: Provide remote access to virtual desktop environments
